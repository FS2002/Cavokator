# CAVOKATOR 

Cavokator is a new android application made by pilots, for pilots, with the goal of allowing a quick and easy access to relevant information necessary for flight planning (weather decoding, NOTAM, etc.).

- Decode NOTAMS
  * Accept IATA or ICAO CODES
  * Show the elapsed time from publication
  * Fully decode ICAO NOTAMS, including categories, subcategories, coordinates (with map view), validity period, altitudes and much more
  * Validity periods are continuously compared to the actual time and the user can easily spot if the NOTAM is currently valid
  * Share individual NOTAMS with images or plain text


- Decode runway condition (MOTNE)
  * Accept several decoding formats <b>(new)</b>
  * Click directly in METAR string to beging decoding <b>(new)</b>
