  * Accept IATA or ICAO codes
  * Show information on the elapsed time from publication
  * Show up to 24 hours worth of METARS
  * Highlight good/poor weather conditions
  * Expand TAFORS for better readability

 - The aim is to include other options in the future, such us:
   * Use a "favourites list"
   * SNOWTAM decoding
   * FUEL UPLIFT calculations
   * Enroute weather information (base on a radius)
   * Select ETD and ETA in order to highlight affected weather
